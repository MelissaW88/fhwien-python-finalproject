## Password Generator
Our passwordgenerator gives the user a secure password with defined criteria.
The criterias the user can choose from are minimum length, numbers and special characters.
The user can put the minimum length in numbers and can say yes or no if they want numbers or special characters.
At the end the user can save the password in a specified file. We also added try-except when any errors occured while saving.
